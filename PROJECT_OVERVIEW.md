# NV Internal - Task Management Application

## Project Overview

NV Internal is a task management application designed for an air conditioning service company in Vietnam. The app helps manage field service operations, including installation, repair, and maintenance tasks performed by technicians at customer locations.

## Scale & Scope

### Current Scale

- **Small Business**: Designed for teams of less than 50 users
- **Air Conditioning Services**: Specialized for cooling/AC system installation, repair, and maintenance
- **Vietnam Market**: Exclusively for operations within Vietnam
- **Field Service Focus**: Optimized for mobile workers who perform tasks at customer locations

### Technical Scale

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Organized with pnpm workspaces
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **API**: RESTful API built with Hono framework
- **Mobile**: Cross-platform React Native app with Expo
- **Authentication**: Clerk for user management and authentication
- **Platform Support**: Android and iOS devices

## Core Features

### Task Management

- **Task Creation**: Admins can create tasks with title, description, customer info, and location
- **Work Type Classification**: Tasks categorized as installation, repair, or maintenance
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks can be assigned to one or multiple workers
- **Status Tracking**: Tasks progress through states: PREPARING â†’ READY â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ ON_HOLD â†’ COMPLETED
- **Location Support**: Tasks can be associated with geographic locations with lat/lng coordinates
- **Customer Management**: Tasks can be linked to customers with contact information

### Check-in/Check-out System

- **Location-based Check-in**: Workers must check in at the task location
- **Photo Verification**: Workers can take photos during check-in/check-out to verify work
- **Time Tracking**: Automatic tracking of time spent on each task
- **Location Validation**: GPS coordinates to verify workers are at the correct location

### User Management

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Two primary roles - Admin and Worker
- **User Profiles**: Basic user information with avatars
- **Authentication**: Secure login with email/password and OAuth options (Google, Apple, GitHub)
- **User Administration**: Admins can create users, manage roles, and ban/unban accounts

### Activity Logging

- **Audit Trail**: All significant actions are logged to the Activity table
- **Action Tracking**: Records who did what, when, and with what payload
- **Topic Filtering**: Activities can be filtered by topic (task, user, etc.)

### Mobile App Features

- **Admin Interface**:
  - Task creation and management
  - User management
  - Overview of all tasks
  - Settings and configuration
- **Worker Interface**:
  - View assigned tasks
  - Check-in/check-out functionality with photo capture
  - Update task status
  - See task details and customer information
  - Navigate to task locations
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete auth flow including sign up, sign in, password reset
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices with touch-friendly interfaces

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (API)

- **Framework**: Hono with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless) with local Docker option
- **ORM**: Prisma with prefixed IDs for readability
- **Authentication**: Clerk JWT middleware
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type safety
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions

### Mobile App

- **Framework**: Expo React Native with file-based routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **UI**: NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) with custom components

- **Authentication**: Clerk SDK with secure token storage
- **Device Support**: Android and iOS platforms

### Shared Packages

- **@nv-internal/prisma-client**: Generated Prisma client with custom extensions
- **@nv-internal/validation**: Shared Zod schemas for type validation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout the codebase
- **Biome**: For consistent formatting and linting
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for critical paths
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation

### Development Workflow

- **Feature Branching**: All work done on feature branches
- **Code Reviews**: Required for all changes
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Environment Management**: Separate environments for dev, staging, and production

### Commit Guidelines

- **Conventional Commits**: Use `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
  - Common scopes: `api`, `mobile`, `prisma`, `validation`, `ci`, `docs`
- **Split commits by concern**: If changes span different areas, create multiple focused commits to ease review, cherry-picking, and reverts. Use `git add -p` to stage by hunk.
- **Pre-commit checks**:
  - Format/lint: `pnpm exec biome check --write .`
  - API tests: `pnpm --filter @nv-internal/api test`
  - Optional (when changing shared packages): `pnpm --filter @nv-internal/prisma-client build && pnpm --filter @nv-internal/validation build`
- See the detailed command flow in `.cursor/commands/commit-changes.md`.

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted data transmission and storage
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all actions
