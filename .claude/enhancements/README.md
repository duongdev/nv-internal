# Enhancement Ideas & Future Features

This directory contains documented enhancement ideas and feature proposals that are not part of the current v1 scope but could be implemented in future iterations.

## Organization

Enhancement files follow the naming pattern:
- `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-description.md` (UTC timestamp for chronological sorting)

## Categories

### Performance Optimizations
- `20251024-105530-location-prefetch-optimization.md` - GPS prefetching for instant check-in/out

### User Experience
- `20251024-120000-pull-to-refresh-improvements.md` - Unified pull-to-refresh across all screens
- `20251024-120100-search-and-filter-system.md` - Comprehensive task search and filtering

### Technical Improvements
- `20251024-120200-e2e-testing-strategy.md` - End-to-end testing with Maestro/Detox for mobile app

### Feature Extensions
- `20251029-173000-employee-summary-report.md` - Monthly summary view for all employees (enhancement to V1 Phase 3)

## Enhancement Status

- **‚è≥ Not Started** - Idea documented but not yet planned
- **üìã Planned** - Scheduled for future implementation
- **üîÑ In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- **‚úÖ Completed** - Successfully implemented
- **‚ùå Rejected** - Decided not to implement with reason

## How to Document New Ideas

1. Create a new file with UTC timestamp: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-description.md`
2. Use the template structure:
   - Overview (what and why)
   - Problem Analysis (current state and pain points)
   - Proposed Solution (technical approach)
   - Implementation Plan (phases and steps)
   - Benefits (user and technical)
   - Considerations (tradeoffs and risks)
   - Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Estimated Effort

3. Link to related implementations and plans
4. Update this README with the enhancement entry

## Priority Guidelines

- **Critical**: Blocking issues or security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Significant UX improvements or performance gains
- **Medium**: Nice-to-have optimizations
- **Low**: Minor improvements or edge cases

## Review Process

Enhancements should be reviewed periodically (monthly) to:
1. Assess if priorities have changed
2. Check if prerequisites are now met
3. Decide on implementation timing
4. Move to active development if approved
