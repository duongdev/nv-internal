# Task Comment System Enhancements

**Created:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** üìã Future Enhancements
**Base Implementation:** `.claude/tasks/20251030-130330-implement-task-comments.md`

## Overview

Based on the successful implementation of the Task Comments feature using the Activity-based architecture, these enhancements would add valuable functionality with minimal effort. All enhancements can be implemented using the existing Activity model pattern.

## Enhancement Ideas

### 1. Comment Editing (Priority: HIGH, Effort: LOW)

**Description:** Allow users to edit their own comments within a time window.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add new action: `TASK_COMMENT_EDITED`
- Store original comment ID and edit history in payload
- Show "edited" indicator with timestamp
- Admin can edit any comment, workers only their own within 15 minutes

**Activity Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'COMMENT_EDIT',
  originalActivityId: 'act_xxx',
  comment: 'Updated comment text',
  previousComment: 'Original text',
  editedAt: '2025-10-31T10:00:00Z'
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Value:** High - users often need to correct typos or add information

---

### 2. Comment Deletion (Priority: MEDIUM, Effort: LOW)

**Description:** Soft delete comments with placeholder text.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add new action: `TASK_COMMENT_DELETED`
- Store original activity ID in payload
- Display "[B√¨nh lu·∫≠n ƒë√£ b·ªã x√≥a]" in activity feed
- Keep record for audit trail
- Admin can delete any, workers only own within 5 minutes

**Activity Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'COMMENT_DELETE',
  originalActivityId: 'act_xxx',
  deletedBy: 'user_xxx',
  reason?: 'Inappropriate content' // Admin only
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours
**Value:** Medium - cleanup capability for mistakes or inappropriate content

---

### 3. @Mentions with Notifications (Priority: HIGH, Effort: MEDIUM)

**Description:** Tag users in comments to notify them.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Parse @username patterns in comment text
- Add `mentionedUsers` array to payload
- Send push notifications to mentioned users
- Highlight mentions in UI with different color
- Auto-complete dropdown when typing @

**Activity Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'COMMENT',
  comment: 'CC @manager v·ªÅ v·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ n√†y',
  mentionedUsers: ['usr_manager123'],
  attachments?: []
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours
**Value:** High - improves team communication and response times

---

### 4. Rich Text Comments (Priority: LOW, Effort: MEDIUM)

**Description:** Support markdown formatting in comments.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Store markdown in comment field
- Use react-native-markdown-display for rendering
- Support: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, lists, links
- Add formatting toolbar above keyboard
- Keep plain text fallback for notifications

**Supported Markdown:**
- Bold: **text**
- Italic: *text*
- Code: `code`
- Lists: - item or 1. item
- Links: [text](url)

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Value:** Low-Medium - nice to have for technical discussions

### 5. Comment Reactions (Priority: LOW, Effort: LOW)

**Description:** Quick emoji reactions to comments.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add new action: `TASK_COMMENT_REACTED`
- Store reactions as array in payload
- Common emojis: üëç üëé ‚ù§Ô∏è üòÑ üéâ ‚úÖ
- Aggregate same reactions with count
- One reaction per user per comment

**Activity Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'COMMENT_REACTION',
  targetActivityId: 'act_xxx',
  reaction: 'üëç',
  action: 'ADD' | 'REMOVE'
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Value:** Low - fun addition for team morale

### 6. Voice Note Comments (Priority: MEDIUM, Effort: HIGH)

**Description:** Record and attach voice notes to comments.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use expo-av for recording
- Upload as attachment with audio MIME type
- Add audio player component in activity feed
- Show duration and waveform visualization
- Transcription option (future enhancement)

**Activity Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'COMMENT',
  comment: '[Ghi √¢m gi·ªçng n√≥i]',
  attachments: [{
    id: 'att_xxx',
    mimeType: 'audio/mp4',
    duration: 15, // seconds
    originalFilename: 'voice-note.m4a'
  }]
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Value:** Medium - useful for field workers who can't type easily

---

### 7. Comment Threading (Priority: LOW, Effort: MEDIUM)

**Description:** Reply to specific comments creating threads.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add `parentActivityId` to payload
- Indent replies visually
- Collapse/expand threads
- Show reply count on parent
- Limit nesting to 2 levels

**Activity Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'COMMENT',
  comment: 'Reply text',
  parentActivityId: 'act_parent_xxx',
  threadDepth: 1
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours
**Value:** Low - current linear feed works well for small teams

### 8. Comment Templates (Priority: MEDIUM, Effort: LOW)

**Description:** Predefined comment templates for common situations.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Store templates in app config or user preferences
- Quick select dropdown above comment box
- Categories: Status updates, Issues, Completions
- Variables: {time}, {date}, {user}

**Example Templates:**
- "ƒê√£ ho√†n th√†nh l√∫c {time}"

- Validate markdown to prevent XSS
- Limit voice note duration and file size
- Rate limit comment creation

---

## Notes

All these enhancements leverage the successful Activity-based architecture established in the base implementation. This approach ensures:

1. **Zero database migrations** - Activity model handles everything
2. **Consistent patterns** - Same implementation approach as base feature
3. **Low risk** - Proven architecture
4. **High reusability** - 85% code reuse from existing patterns
5. **Easy rollback** - New action types don't affect existing ones

The Activity model's flexibility makes these enhancements straightforward to implement whenever the team is ready to enhance the commenting system further.
