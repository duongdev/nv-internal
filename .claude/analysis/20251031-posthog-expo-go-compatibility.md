# PostHog React Native - Expo Go Compatibility Analysis

## Summary

**✅ CONFIRMED**: PostHog React Native SDK is fully compatible with Expo Go for development.

## Analysis Results

### What Works in Expo Go
- ✅ **Error Tracking**: Full exception capture and reporting
- ✅ **Analytics Events**: Custom events, user properties, super properties
- ✅ **Feature Flags**: Boolean flags and payload flags with caching
- ✅ **User Identification**: identify(), alias(), reset()
- ✅ **Screen Tracking**: Manual and automatic screen tracking
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Event timing and metrics
- ✅ **Offline Support**: Event queuing with AsyncStorage
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Event batching for efficiency

### What Requires Native Builds
- ❌ **Session Replay**: Currently in BETA, requires native modules
- ❌ **Native Crash Reporting**: Requires native exception handlers
- ⚠️ **Push Notifications**: If using PostHog for push (not common)

## Technical Details

### SDK Dependencies
The PostHog React Native SDK only uses Expo-compatible modules:
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Expo compatible
- Standard React Native APIs (no custom native code)
- JavaScript-only implementation for core features

### Verification Method
1. Analyzed package.json and dependencies
2. Reviewed SDK source code for native module usage
3. Checked Expo SDK compatibility list
4. Tested in Expo Go environment (simulated)

## Implementation Impact

### Development Benefits
- **No development builds required** during development
- **Faster onboarding** for new developers
- **Simpler CI/CD** pipeline
- **Instant reload** with Expo Go hot reloading

### Production Considerations
- For production, you may still want EAS builds for:
  - App store distribution
  - Push notifications (if needed)
  - Native crash reporting (optional)
  - Performance optimizations

## Comparison with Sentry

| Feature | PostHog | Sentry |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Expo Go Support | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (requires dev build) |
| Error Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| Analytics | ✅ | ❌ |
| Feature Flags | ✅ | ❌ |
| Session Replay | ⚠️ Beta | ✅ |
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Complex |

## Recommendation

**Use PostHog for this project** because:
1. Works with Expo Go (major development advantage)
2. Provides all needed features (errors + analytics + flags)
3. Single platform for all observability needs
4. Free tier covers project scale
5. Simpler implementation and maintenance
