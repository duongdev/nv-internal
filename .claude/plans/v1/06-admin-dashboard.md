## Overview

Build a mobile-first admin dashboard that displays meaningful metrics and insights for administrators through a card-based interface similar to the task details screen.

### Key Features

- üìä **Today's Overview**: Tasks today, active workers, in-progress, overdue
- üìà **Task Distribution**: Status breakdown with percentages
- üïê **Recent Activity**: Last 10 activities with task references
- üë• **Worker Performance**: Assigned/completed tasks per worker
- ‚ö° **Quick Actions**: Create task, view all, manage employees

### Architecture Highlights

**No Database Changes:** Uses existing Task, Activity, Customer, and GeoLocation models.

**API Endpoints:**
```typescript
GET /v1/dashboard/stats       // Aggregated statistics
GET /v1/dashboard/activities  // Recent activity feed with pagination
```

**Card-Based UI:** Reuses existing card components from task details screen for consistency.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk üî¥

None identified for Phase 1.

### Medium Risk üü°

1. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Risk: Aggregation queries may be slow with >1000 tasks
   - Mitigation: Database indexing, pagination, caching

2. **Stale Data**
   - Risk: Dashboard shows outdated information
   - Mitigation: Appropriate cache times (5 min), manual refresh option

### Low Risk üü¢

3. **Admin Role Enforcement**
   - Risk: Non-admin users access dashboard
   - Mitigation: Middleware checks, backend validation

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2-4)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Metrics
- Check-in compliance tracking
- Location-based insights
- Time-on-site analytics

### Phase 3: Financial Dashboard
- Payment tracking card
