# NV Internal v1 Development Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Project:** Air Conditioning Service Task Management Application
**Target Users:** <50 users (Admin & Field Workers)

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development plan for NV Internal v1, a task management application for an air conditioning service company in Vietnam. The system consists of a REST API (Hono + PostgreSQL) and a React Native mobile app (Expo + Clerk Auth), designed to manage field worker tasks, check-ins/check-outs with GPS verification, and payment tracking.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk =4

1. **GPS Accuracy Issues**
   - **Risk:** GPS may be inaccurate in urban areas or indoors
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Allow manual override with reason
     - Admin can review flagged check-ins
     - Use higher accuracy GPS mode
     - Configurable distance threshold

2. **Offline Functionality**
   - **Risk:** Workers may have poor network in the field
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Implement offline support for Phase 6
     - Cache task details for offline viewing
     - Queue check-in/out when offline
     - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

3. **Data Migration**
   - **Risk:** Schema changes may require data migration
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use Prisma migrations properly
     - Test migrations on staging first
     - Backup database before migration
     - Have rollback plan

### Medium Risk =á

4. **Revenue Calculation Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Multi-worker revenue splits may be complex
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Start with simple equal split
     - Allow manual override by admin
     - Document calculation logic clearly

5. **Photo Storage Costs**
   - **Risk:** Vercel Blob costs may increase with many photos
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Compress images before upload
     - Generate thumbnails for previews
     - Monitor storage usage
     - Consider cheaper storage alternatives

### Low Risk =â

6. **User Adoption**
   - **Risk:** Workers may resist new technology
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Simple, intuitive UI
     - Vietnamese language support
     - In-person training
     - Admin can monitor usage

## Open Questions

1. **Payment Structure:**
   - How is revenue split for multi-worker tasks? (Equal split or configurable?)
   - Can a task have multiple partial payments?
   - Who determines when payment is complete - admin or system?

2. **Check-in/Check-out:**
   - What is the acceptable GPS accuracy threshold? (Recommend 100m)
   - Can workers check-in/out without network? (Recommend offline queue)
   - Can workers check-in early or check-out late?

3. **Employee Management:**
   - Should deleting an employee be soft delete or hard delete?
