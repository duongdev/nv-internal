# Implement Check-in/Checkout Frontend

## Overview

Implementing the mobile UI for GPS-verified check-in/check-out system with multiple attachment support. This follows the architecture defined in `.claude/plans/v1/02-checkin-checkout-frontend.md`.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All phases finished, tested, integrated, and polished

## Related Plans

- **Parent Plan**: `.claude/plans/v1/02-checkin-checkout.md`
- **Frontend Spec**: `.claude/plans/v1/02-checkin-checkout-frontend.md`
- **Common Spec**: `.claude/plans/v1/02-checkin-checkout-common.md`
- **Backend Implementation**: `.claude/plans/v1/02-checkin-checkout-backend.md` (✅ Completed)

## Architecture Overview

### Key Design Principles

1. **Shared Component Pattern**: Single `TaskEventScreen` component handles both check-in and check-out
2. **Behavior-Driven by Props**: Configuration objects define differences between events
3. **Multiple Attachments**: Support 1-10 files from camera, library, or file picker
4. **Code Reuse**: ~95% code reuse between check-in and check-out screens
5. **Unified Activity Feed**: All events appear in chronological activity feed

3. Add distance visualization in activity history
4. Add photo comparison (check-in vs check-out) view

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### 1. 400 Validation Error on Check-in/Checkout (✅ Fixed)

**Issue**: Check-in and check-out API endpoints were returning 400 validation errors when called from the mobile app.

**Root Cause**:
- When uploading a single file via `multipart/form-data`, Hono receives it as a single `File` object (not an array)
- When uploading multiple files, Hono receives it as `File[]` array
- The validation schema only expected an array, causing single-file uploads to fail
- Additionally, FormData sends all values as strings, but the schema expected numbers for latitude/longitude

**Solution Applied**:
1. Updated `packages/validation/src/check-in.zod.ts`:
   - Changed latitude/longitude to use `z.coerce.number()` to handle string-to-number conversion
   - Changed files field to accept both `File` and `File[]` using `z.union()`
   - Added `.transform()` to normalize single files to arrays
   - Then pipe to array validation for 1-10 files

2. Removed debug logging from `apps/api/src/v1/task-events/route.ts`

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/validation/src/check-in.zod.ts` - Fixed validation schema
- `apps/api/src/v1/task-events/route.ts` - Cleaned up debug logging

**Testing**:
- ✅ All existing unit tests pass (9/9)
- ✅ Check-in works with single and multiple files
- ✅ Check-out works with single and multiple files
- ✅ GPS coordinates properly coerced from strings to numbers

### 2. Cache Invalidation After Check-in/Out (✅ Fixed)

**Issue**: Task details, status, and activity feed not updating after successful check-in/out operations.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `useQueryClient` to `apps/mobile/hooks/use-task-event.ts`
- Invalidate queries after successful submission:
  - `['task', taskId]` - task details including status and attachments
  - `['tasks']` - task list to update status changes
  - `['activities', 'TASK_${taskId}']` - activity feed for new events

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/mobile/hooks/use-task-event.ts` - Added query invalidation after successful submission

### 3. Activity Feed Rendering for Check-in/Out (✅ Implemented)

**Issue**: Check-in/out events not displayed in activity feed.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added rendering for `TASK_CHECKED_IN` and `TASK_CHECKED_OUT` action types
- Display components:
  - Main action text (bold)
  - Distance from task location with proper formatting (50m, 1.5km)
  - Warnings in amber card with AlertTriangle icon (16px, text-xs)
  - Notes in bordered card with MessageSquare icon
  - Attachments using compact attachment list
- Icons vertically centered with first line of text using `mt-0.5`
- Consistent styling with location-verification component

**Features**:
- Distance formatting: < 1000m shows meters, ≥ 1000m shows km with 1 decimal
- Warning card: amber background, smaller icon and text for subtle appearance
- Notes card: muted colors with icon for visual hierarchy
- Proper Vietnamese labels throughout

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/mobile/components/activity-feed.tsx` - Added check-in/out event rendering with distance, warnings, notes, and attachments
