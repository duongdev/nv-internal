# Backend Refactoring - Executive Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive backend refactoring plan to improve code quality, maintainability, and align with SOLID principles for the NV Internal API.

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues**:
- 40-60% code duplication across services
- Hard to test (tight coupling, direct Prisma dependencies)
- Mixed concerns (authorization, business logic, database operations in same functions)
- Inconsistent error handling
- Average file size: 335 lines (target: <250 lines)
- Test coverage: 40% (target: 60-70%)

**Impact**:
- Slower feature development
- Higher bug rates
- Difficult onboarding for new developers
- Technical debt accumulation

## Proposed Solution

**Architecture**: Routes (Hono) → Services → Repositories (selective) → Infrastructure

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Request-Scoped Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling, easy testing
2. **Selective Repository Pattern** - Abstract complex queries only
3. **Unified Error Handling** - Consistent Vietnamese error messages
4. **AuthorizationService** - Centralized permission logic
5. **StorageFactory** - Plugin architecture for file storage

**What We're NOT Doing** (Expert recommendations):
- ❌ No controller layer (doesn't fit Hono philosophy)
- ❌ No DTOs initially (Prisma types + Zod sufficient)
- ✅ Selective repositories only (not all CRUD operations)

## Timeline & Phases

**Total Duration**: 18-20 weeks

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Week 0 | 5-7 days | Critical setup & research |
| Phase 0 (Optional) | 1-2 weeks | Quick wins validation |
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | Foundation (DI, errors, auth) |
| Phase 2 | 3 weeks | Selective repositories |
| Phase 3 | 3 weeks | Service refactoring |
| Phase 4 | 2 weeks | Production migration |
| Phase 5 | 2 weeks | Hardening & testing |
| Phase 6 | 4 weeks | Buffer & improvements |

## Risk & Mitigation

**Risk Level**: Low (with proper mitigation)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- ✅ Feature flags for gradual rollout
- ✅ Parallel running (old + new code)
- ✅ Performance benchmarking at each phase
- ✅ Backward compatible database changes
- ✅ Comprehensive rollback playbook
- ✅ 4-week buffer for unexpected issues

**Production Safety**:
- Zero downtime deployment
- Instant rollback capability
- 10% → 50% → 100% traffic shift
- Continuous monitoring

## Expected Outcomes

### Code Quality
- **File Size**: 335 lines → <250 lines (-25%)
- **Test Coverage**: 40% → 60-70% (+50-75%)
- **Code Duplication**: 40-60% → <20% (-67%)
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved (SOLID principles)

### Performance (Serverless-Optimized)
- **Cold Start**: <200ms p95
- **Warm Requests**: <50ms p95
- **Memory Usage**: <800MB peak (within 1024MB limit)
- **Bundle Size**: +50% max (not +148% - optimized)

### Developer Experience
- **New Features**: 20% faster development
- **Bug Fixes**: 25% faster resolution
- **Testing**: Easy mocking with DI
- **Onboarding**: Clearer code structure

### Business Impact
- ✅ Zero production incidents from refactoring (goal)
- ✅ API availability > 99.9% maintained
- ✅ Team velocity maintained during migration
- ✅ Reduced technical debt

## Cost Estimate

**Development Time**: ~400 hours (2-3 developers × 18-20 weeks)

**Breakdown**:
- Week 0 Setup: 40 hours
- Phase 0 (Optional): 40 hours
- Phase 1-3 (Core refactoring): 200 hours
- Phase 4-5 (Migration & hardening): 80 hours
- Phase 6 (Buffer): 40 hours

**Benefits**:
- Long-term velocity increase (20% faster features)
- Reduced bug fixes (25% faster)
- Better code quality (easier maintenance)
- **ROI**: Positive within 6-12 months

## Success Metrics

**Phase Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (zero errors)
- ✅ Biome checks pass
- ✅ Test coverage meets phase target
- ✅ Performance benchmarks pass
- ✅ No production incidents

**Overall Success**:
- [ ] All phases completed on schedule
- [ ] Performance targets achieved
- [ ] Test coverage > 65%
- [ ] Code duplication < 20%
- [ ] Team trained on new patterns
