# Admin and Worker Module Layout Improvements

## Overview

This task focuses on improving the admin and worker module layouts to enhance usability and efficiency. The admin module needs tab reorganization and removal of the unimplemented dashboard, while both modules require enriched task list features including search, filtering, and better information display.

**Type**: Feature Enhancement
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-30 05:19:55 UTC
**Updated**: 2025-10-30 19:00:00 UTC
**Status**: ✅ Completed (Phase 1 & 2 + Critical Test Fix)

## Current State Analysis

### Admin Module Tab Layout
**Current Tab Order**: Trang chủ (Home) → Nhân viên (Employees) → Công việc (Tasks) → Cài đặt (Settings)

Issues:
- Dashboard tab ("Trang chủ") is shown but not implemented (displays placeholder text)
- Tab order doesn't reflect usage priority - Tasks should come first for admins
- Landing on an unimplemented feature creates poor first impression

### Worker Module Tab Layout
**Current Tab Order**: Công việc (Tasks) → Cài đặt (Settings)

Structure is appropriate but task list needs enhancement.

### Task List Implementation Analysis

**Current Admin Task List** (`/apps/mobile/components/admin-task-list.tsx`):
- Uses `useTaskInfiniteList()` hook with cursor-based pagination
- Basic infinite scroll with pull-to-refresh
- Displays tasks in cards with `TaskListItem` component
- No search or filter capabilities
- Links to `/admin/tasks/[taskId]/view` for details

**Current Worker Task List** (`/apps/mobile/app/worker/(tabs)/index.tsx`):
- Uses `useAssignedTaskInfiniteList()` with status filtering
- Groups tasks by status (In Progress → Next → Completed)
- Section headers are sticky
- Better organization than admin view but still lacks search/filter

**Task List Item Component** (`/apps/mobile/components/task-list-item.tsx`):
Currently displays:
- Task ID (formatted)
- Title
- Description (truncated to 2 lines)
- Assignees (names with separators)
- Location address
- Status badge
- Payment status badge (if applicable)

**Available Task Data from API**:
- Basic: id, title, description, status, createdAt
- Relations: customer, geoLocation, attachments (count), payments (latest)
- Arrays: assigneeIds
- Financial: expectedRevenue

**Current API Filtering Support**:
- `status`: Filter by task status (single or array)
- `assignedOnly`: Boolean to filter user's assigned tasks
- `cursor`: For pagination
- `take`: Limit results

Missing API capabilities:
- Text search (title, description, customer)
- Date range filtering
- Location-based filtering
- Customer filtering
- Priority/urgency filtering

## Requirements Breakdown

### Phase 1: Admin Tab Reorganization (Quick Win)

1. **Hide Dashboard Tab**
   - Remove/comment out home tab from `admin/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
   - Update index redirect logic to go to tasks instead

2. **Reorder Tabs**
   - New order: Tasks → Users → Settings
   - Tasks becomes the default landing tab

3. **Update Navigation**
   - Ensure deep links still work correctly
   - Test tab switching with new order

### Phase 2: Task Information Enhancement

#### Admin Task List Enhancements

**Rich Information Display**:
- Show customer name and phone (currently not displayed)
- Display creation date/time
- Show attachment count with icon
- Display full assignee list (currently shows names)
- Show last activity/update time
- Add urgency indicators (overdue, today, upcoming)
- Display expected revenue prominently

**Visual Improvements**:
- Color-coded status badges (use existing `TaskStatusBadge`)
- Payment status indicators (use existing `PaymentStatusBadge`)
- Attachment icon with count
- Better spacing and typography hierarchy
- Touch-friendly card design (min 44px touch targets)

#### Worker Task List Enhancements

**Rich Information Display** (Worker-focused):
- Customer contact info prominently displayed (tap to call/message)
- Clear location with map link capability
- Time since assignment
- Check-in status indicator
- Payment collection status
- Priority/urgency indicators
- Task notes/special instructions highlighted

**Worker-Specific Features**:
- Quick actions (check-in, navigate, call customer)
- Status-based coloring for urgency
- Today's tasks highlighted
- Overdue tasks with warning styling

### Phase 3: Search Implementation

**Search Strategy**:
- Client-side search using Fuse.js (following existing pattern)
- Vietnamese accent-insensitive search (use `removeVietnameseAccents`)
- Search across multiple fields

**Searchable Fields**:
- Task ID (exact and partial match)
- Title
- Description
- Customer name
- Customer phone
- Address
- Assignee names

**Implementation Pattern** (based on `useUserSearch` hook):
```typescript
interface SearchableTask extends Task {
  searchTitle: string
  searchDescription: string
  searchCustomer: string
  searchAddress: string
  searchAssignees: string
}
```

**UI Design**:
- Sticky search bar below header
- Clear button when search active
- Search icon with placeholder text
- Instant results (no submit needed)
- Result count indicator

### Phase 4: Filter Implementation

**Filter Categories**:

1. **Status Filters** (Multi-select):
   - Preparing
   - Ready
   - In Progress
   - On Hold
   - Completed

2. **Assignment Filters**:
   - My Tasks (assigned to me)
   - Unassigned
   - Specific Employee (admin only)

3. **Time Filters**:
   - Today
   - This Week
   - This Month
   - Overdue
   - Custom date range

4. **Payment Filters**:
   - Paid
   - Unpaid
   - Partially Paid
   - No Payment Expected

5. **Location Filters** (if feasible):
   - District/Area grouping
   - Near me (GPS-based)

**UI Pattern**:
- Filter button in header (badge with active filter count)
- Bottom sheet for filter selection (use existing pattern)
- Multi-select with checkboxes
- "Apply" and "Reset" buttons
- Persist filter preferences locally

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization

**List Performance**:
- Implement `getItemLayout` for FlatList (known heights)
- Use `removeClippedSubviews` for better scrolling
- Optimize re-renders with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Implement virtualization window tuning
- Add skeleton loading states

**Search Performance**:
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Optimize Fuse.js threshold for accuracy vs speed
- Cache search results
- Limit initial display to 50 items

**Data Management**:
- Implement smart cache invalidation
- Prefetch next page before reaching end
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background refresh on focus

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX Patterns to Follow

1. **Bottom Sheet Pattern** (from user selection):
   - Use `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` for filters
   - Set `index={1}` for 90% initial height
   - Use `BottomSheetFlatList` for scrollable content
   - Place action buttons in footer

2. **Search Pattern** (from user search):
   - Vietnamese accent-insensitive using `removeVietnameseAccents`
   - Fuse.js for fuzzy matching and typo tolerance
   - Threshold of 0.3 for balanced accuracy
   - Search across normalized fields

3. **List Pattern** (from employee summary):
   - Always use FlatList over ScrollView
   - Implement proper virtualization
   - Sticky headers for sections
   - Pull-to-refresh with haptic feedback

4. **Navigation Pattern** (from recent fixes):
   - Use stable Tabs component (not NativeTabs)
   - Add haptic feedback on interactions
   - Avoid Stack `screenOptions` (causes overlay issues)

### Mobile-First Considerations

1. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
2. **Gestures**: Swipe actions for quick task operations
3. **Offline Support**: Cache task data for offline viewing
4. **Responsive**: Adapt to different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility**: Proper labels and hints for screen readers

## Technical Considerations

### API Enhancements Needed

For optimal search/filter, the API should support:
1. Text search query parameter
2. Date range filtering
3. Customer ID filtering
4. Enhanced sorting options
5. Aggregation for filter counts

These can be added incrementally without breaking changes.

### State Management

- Use TanStack Query for server state
- Local state for filters/search
- Consider Zustand for complex filter state
- Persist user preferences in AsyncStorage

### Security Considerations

- Respect role-based access in search results
- Don't expose sensitive data in search indices
- Validate filter parameters
- Prevent injection in search queries

## Dependencies

- Existing components: TaskListItem, TaskStatusBadge, PaymentStatusBadge
- Libraries: fuse.js (already installed), @gorhom/bottom-sheet
- Utilities: removeVietnameseAccents, formatTaskId
- Hooks: useUserSearch pattern to follow

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance degradation with large lists | High | Implement virtualization and pagination |
| Search accuracy vs performance tradeoff | Medium | Tune Fuse.js threshold, add caching |
| Filter complexity overwhelming users | Medium | Start with essential filters, progressive disclosure |
| API limitations for advanced filtering | High | Implement client-side filtering first, enhance API later |
| Breaking existing navigation patterns | High | Thorough testing, keep old routes working |

## Follow-up Enhancements

After this implementation, consider:
1. Task templates for common jobs
2. Bulk operations (assign multiple, status update)
3. Smart filters (AI-suggested based on usage)
4. Saved filter presets
5. Export filtered lists
6. Calendar view for scheduled tasks
7. Map view for location-based task planning
8. Voice search for hands-free operation

## Notes

- This improvement directly impacts daily operations for all users
- Prioritize worker efficiency as they use the app most frequently
- Admin features should focus on oversight and management
- Consider phased rollout to gather feedback
- Document new patterns for future development
