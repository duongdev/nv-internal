# Fix Summary: Multi-Word Phrase Search Issue

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Impact**: High (Critical search functionality)

## Problem in One Sentence

Multi-word phrase searches like "Mua quat" were returning empty results because `undefined` was being passed to Prisma query conditions, causing unpredictable PostgreSQL behavior.

## Root Cause

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - This caused the bug
{
  id: {
    equals: Number.isNaN(Number.parseInt(search))
      ? undefined  // Passed to Prisma!
      : Number.parseInt(search),
  },
}
```

When searching for "Mua quat", `Number.parseInt("Mua quat")` returns `NaN`, so the condition became:
```typescript
{ id: { equals: undefined } }
```

According to Prisma documentation:
> "When a value used in a query is null or undefined, Prisma may return either the first document or all documents, which can cause unexpected behavior."

## Solution

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Only add ID condition if search is a valid number
const searchConditions: Prisma.TaskWhereInput[] = []

const searchAsNumber = Number.parseInt(search, 10)
if (!Number.isNaN(searchAsNumber)) {
  searchConditions.push({ id: { equals: searchAsNumber } })
}

// Add other search conditions...
```

## Testing

Created 4 comprehensive test suites with 22 new tests:
- `task-search-phrase.test.ts` (10 tests)
- `task-search-real-scenario.test.ts` (4 tests)
- `task-search-undefined-fix.test.ts` (6 tests)
- `debug-search.test.ts` (2 tests)

All 234 tests pass, including all existing tests.

## Files Changed

1. **Modified**: `apps/api/src/v1/task/task.service.ts`
   - Changed search condition construction to conditionally add ID filter
   - Prevents undefined from being passed to Prisma

2. **Added**: 4 test files with comprehensive coverage

3. **Documented**: Complete task documentation with investigation process and learnings

## Key Learning

**Never pass undefined to Prisma query conditions.** Always conditionally add query conditions based on value validity.

## Verification

```
BEFORE: Search "Mua quat" → Found 0 tasks ❌
AFTER:  Search "Mua quat" → Found 1 task ✅
```

## Impact

- Fixed critical search functionality for multi-word queries
- Improved user experience for Vietnamese text search
- Prevents future issues with undefined in Prisma queries
- Comprehensive test coverage prevents regression
