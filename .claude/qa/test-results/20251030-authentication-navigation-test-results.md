- ⏳ Could not fully verify RBAC enforcement due to logout error overlay
- ⏳ Could not test admin route access attempts

### ⚠️ Result: **PARTIALLY PASSED** (Blocked by logout error)
Initial RBAC appears to be working (auto-navigation to worker module), but full testing blocked by critical logout error.

---

## Test Scenario 5: Authentication - Logout & Cache Clearing

### 🎯 Objective
Verify logout clears all cached data and returns to login screen without errors

### Test Steps & Results

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|------|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Navigate to settings (worker) | Settings screen | ✅ Settings displayed | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | Click "Đăng xuất" button | Confirmation dialog | ✅ Dialog appeared | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | Confirm logout | Logout process starts | ✅ Logout initiated | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | Wait for logout to complete | Return to login screen | ✅ Login screen appeared | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | Verify no error toasts | Clean logout | ❌ **RED ERROR TOAST DISPLAYED** | ❌ FAIL |
| 6 | Check console | No errors | ❌ **CRITICAL ERROR IN CONSOLE** | ❌ FAIL |
| 7 | Login as different user | Fresh session | ⏳ Blocked by error overlay | ⏳ BLOCKED |
| 8 | Verify cache cleared | No previous user data | ⏳ Could not verify | ⏳ BLOCKED |

### 🐛 Critical Bug Found: Logout Error

**Error Message**: `Logout error: Error: You are signed out`

**Error Location**: Line 129 in logout handler
```typescript
if (router.canDismiss()) {  // ← Error occurs here
  router.dismissAll()
}
router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
```

**Error Type**: Console Error (Red overlay in development mode)

**Impact**:
- Blocks all further testing after logout
- Error overlay persists even after app restart
- Prevents testing of cache clearing verification
- Prevents testing of module preference persistence

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The error occurs because `router.canDismiss()` is being called when the user is already signed out (after Clerk.signOut()), which throws an error "You are signed out". This error is caught and logged, but the error overlay blocks the UI.

**Recommended Fix**:
```typescript
try {
  // Sign out from Clerk first
  await clerk.signOut()

  // Clear caches
  queryClient.clear()
  // ... other cleanup

  // Navigate without checking canDismiss since we're already signed out
  router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
} catch (error) {
  // Silently handle expected "You are signed out" errors
  if (!error.message?.includes('signed out')) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error)
  }
  // Always navigate to login regardless of error
  router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
}
```

### ❌ Result: **FAILED**
Logout functionality has a critical error that blocks the UI and prevents further testing. While the basic logout flow works (returns to login screen), the error handling is incorrect.

---

## Test Scenario 6: Module Preference Persistence

### 🎯 Objective
Verify that admin users' module preference persists across app restarts

### Test Steps & Results

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|------|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Switch to worker module | Worker module loads | ✅ Verified in earlier test | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | Kill app completely | App closes | ⏳ Not tested | ⏳ BLOCKED |
| 3 | Reopen app | Worker module loads | ⏳ Not tested | ⏳ BLOCKED |
| 4 | Verify persistence | Module preference saved | ⏳ Not tested | ⏳ BLOCKED |

### ⏳ Result: **BLOCKED**
Could not test module preference persistence due to logout error preventing clean app restart cycle.

## Bugs & Issues Found

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Bug #1: Logout Error Blocking UI

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix before release
**Status**: 🔴 Open

**Description**: After logout, a console error "Logout error: Error: You are signed out" appears with a red error overlay that blocks the entire UI and persists even after app restart.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Login to the app (any user)
2. Navigate to settings
3. Click "Đăng xuất" (Logout)
4. Confirm logout
5. Observe red error toast at bottom
6. App navigates to login but error persists

**Expected Behavior**:
- Clean logout with no errors
- Return to login screen
- No error toasts or overlays

**Actual Behavior**:
- Red error toast: "Logout error: Error: You are signed out"
- Red error overlay blocking UI in development mode
- Error persists across app restarts

**Error Details**:
```
File: (user settings or auth context)
Line: 129
Code: if (router.canDismiss()) {
Error: "Error: You are signed out"
```

**Impact**:
- Blocks all further testing
- Poor user experience
- Cannot verify cache clearing
- Cannot test module preference persistence
- Makes development testing difficult

**Related Code**: `.claude/tasks/20251029-192714-fix-authentication-cache-rbac-persistence.md` - Logout handler implementation

**Recommended Fix**: See Test Scenario 5 for detailed fix recommendation

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (P0)
1. **FIX LOGOUT ERROR**: Update logout handler to properly handle "signed out" state
   - Remove or wrap `router.canDismiss()` call in try-catch
   - Ensure navigation always succeeds regardless of errors
   - Suppress expected "signed out" errors from console

### High Priority (P1)
2. **COMPLETE CACHE CLEARING TESTING**: After fixing logout error, verify:
   - TanStack Query cache is cleared
   - No data from previous session visible
   - All API calls are fresh (not from cache)

3. **VERIFY MODULE PREFERENCE PERSISTENCE**: Test full app restart cycle:
   - Switch modules
   - Kill app
   - Reopen app
   - Verify preference persisted

4. **TEST WORKER RBAC FULLY**: Verify worker cannot access admin routes:
   - Try URL manipulation to /admin routes
   - Attempt admin API calls
   - Verify navigation guards work

### Medium Priority (P2)
5. **ADD ERROR BOUNDARY**: Implement error boundary to prevent error overlays from blocking UI in production
6. **IMPROVE ERROR HANDLING**: Add better error messages for logout failures
7. **ADD LOADING STATES**: Show loading indicator during logout process

### Nice to Have (P3)
8. **ADD AUTOMATED TESTS**: Create automated E2E tests for navigation and auth flows
9. **IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY**: Add more comprehensive accessibility testing
10. **PERFORMANCE MONITORING**: Add metrics for tab switching performance

## Sign-off

### Test Status: ⚠️ CANNOT SIGN OFF

**Reason**: Critical logout error (Bug #1) prevents full test coverage and blocks key security features (cache clearing, RBAC verification).

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Fix Bug #1 (logout error)
2. Re-run full test suite
3. Complete blocked test scenarios
4. Verify cache clearing works
5. Verify module preference persistence
6. Verify comprehensive RBAC enforcement

### Tester Notes:
The navigation fixes are **excellent** - all tabs are now fully responsive and the header configuration is correct. However, the logout error is a **critical blocker** that must be fixed before this feature set can be considered production-ready. The error prevents verification of the most critical security fixes (cache clearing and RBAC).

**Estimated Re-test Time**: 1-2 hours after bug fix
