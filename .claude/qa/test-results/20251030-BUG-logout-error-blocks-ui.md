# BUG REPORT: Logout Error Blocks UI

**Bug ID**: BUG-20251030-001
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - Must Fix Before Release
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Reported By**: QA UI Agent (Mobile-MCP)
**Date Reported**: 2025-10-30
**Date Resolved**: 2025-10-30
**Environment**: Development (Expo Go on iOS Simulator)
**Fixed By**: Claude Code (Backend Expert)

---

## Summary

After logout, a console error "Logout error: Error: You are signed out" appears with a red error overlay that blocks the entire UI and persists even after app restart, preventing further testing and use of the application.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Launch the app (Expo Go)
2. Login with any valid credentials (tested with admin01:admin01)
3. Navigate to any module (admin or worker)
4. Go to Settings (Cài đặt)
5. Click "Đăng xuất" (Logout button)
6. Confirm logout in dialog
7. Observe the error

**Reproducibility**: 100% (Occurs every time)

---

## Expected Behavior

1. User clicks logout
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms logout
4. App clears all cached data (TanStack Query cache, AsyncStorage, SecureStore)
5. App navigates to login screen cleanly
6. **NO error toasts or overlays appear**
7. User can immediately login again

---

## Actual Behavior

1. User clicks logout ✅
2. Confirmation dialog appears ✅
3. User confirms logout ✅
4. Cache clearing status: ⏳ Unknown (blocked by error)
5. App navigates to login screen ✅
6. **❌ RED ERROR TOAST appears at bottom: "Logout error: Error: You are signed out"**
7. **❌ RED ERROR OVERLAY blocks entire UI in development mode**
8. Error persists even after:
   - Tapping anywhere on screen
   - Pressing HOME button and relaunching
   - Restarting Expo server

**Result**: Cannot use the app or continue testing after logout.

## Error Details

### Error Message
```
Logout error: Error: You are signed out
```

### Error Location
```typescript
File: (Auth context or user settings handler)
Line: 129

Code causing error:
if (router.canDismiss()) {  // ← Error thrown here
  router.dismissAll()
}
router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
```

### Error Stack Trace
```
Call Stack:
  handleLogout
  apps/mobile/contexts/auth.tsx:129

Error occurs when calling: router.canDismiss()
Reason: User is already signed out from Clerk, so router operations throw error
```

### Error Overlay Screenshot Description
- Red header bar with "Console Error"
- "Log 1 of 1" indicator
- Error message: "Logout error: Error: You are signed out"
- Source code showing lines 127-132
- Code snippet shows `router.canDismiss()` call
- "Dismiss" and "Minimize" buttons at bottom (but error persists)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Cause
The logout handler calls `router.canDismiss()` **after** calling `clerk.signOut()`. Once the user is signed out from Clerk, the router navigation methods throw an error because Clerk's authentication context has been cleared.

### Execution Flow (Problematic)
```typescript
1. clerk.signOut() is called
   → User is now signed out from Clerk
   → Auth context cleared

2. router.canDismiss() is called
   → Router tries to check navigation state
   → Fails because auth context is cleared
   → Throws: "Error: You are signed out"

3. Error is caught and logged
   → console.error("Logout error:", error)
   → Error appears in UI as red toast/overlay

4. Navigation still succeeds
   → router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in') works
   → But error overlay remains visible
```

### Why It's a Problem
1. **Poor UX**: Users see an error during a successful operation
2. **Blocks Testing**: Error overlay prevents QA from continuing tests
3. **Development Friction**: Developers see error on every logout during development
4. **False Negative**: Successful logout appears to be a failure
5. **Security Concern**: Cannot verify cache clearing works properly

---

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact
- **End Users**: Will see red error toast on every logout
- **Developers**: Cannot test logout flow without error
- **QA Team**: Cannot complete authentication testing

### Feature Impact
- ❌ **Cache Clearing**: Cannot verify it works (blocked by error)
- ❌ **Module Preference**: Cannot test persistence across restarts
- ❌ **RBAC Testing**: Cannot verify worker access control fully
- ❌ **Session Management**: Cannot test logout/login cycles

### Business Impact
- **Severity**: Critical - Blocks release
- **Affected Users**: 100% of users who logout
- **Frequency**: Every logout
- **Workaround**: None (error persists)

---

## Recommended Fix

### Solution 1: Remove canDismiss Check (Preferred)
Since we're navigating to login after logout, we don't need to check if we can dismiss. Just navigate directly.

```typescript
const handleLogout = async () => {
  try {
    // 1. Clear TanStack Query cache
    queryClient.clear()

    // 2. Clear AsyncStorage (except preferences)
    const keysToKeep = ['modulePreference']
    const allKeys = await AsyncStorage.getAllKeys()
    const keysToRemove = allKeys.filter(key => !keysToKeep.includes(key))
    await AsyncStorage.multiRemove(keysToRemove)

    // 3. Clear SecureStore
    await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('jwt_token')
    await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('user_data')

    // 4. Sign out from Clerk
    await clerk.signOut()

    // 5. Navigate to login (no canDismiss check needed)
    //    Replace current route with login
    router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
  } catch (error) {
    // Only log unexpected errors (not "signed out" errors)
    if (!error.message?.includes('signed out')) {
      console.error('Logout error:', error)
      // Could show user-friendly toast here
    }

    // ALWAYS navigate to login, even if there was an error
    router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
  }
}
```

### Solution 2: Suppress "Signed Out" Errors
If keeping canDismiss check, suppress the expected error:

```typescript
try {
  await clerk.signOut()

  if (router.canDismiss()) {
    router.dismissAll()
  }
  router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
} catch (error) {
  // Silently ignore "signed out" errors - they're expected
  if (error.message?.includes('signed out')) {
    // This is expected after clerk.signOut(), just navigate
    router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
    return
  }

  // Log other unexpected errors
  console.error('Unexpected logout error:', error)
  router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')
}
```

### Solution 3: Change Execution Order
Call navigation methods before signing out:

```typescript
try {
  // 1. Clear navigation stack first (before signing out)
  if (router.canDismiss()) {
    router.dismissAll()
  }

  // 2. Navigate to login
  router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in')

  // 3. Then clean up auth state
  queryClient.clear()
  await AsyncStorage cleanup...
  await SecureStore cleanup...
  await clerk.signOut()
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Logout error:', error)
}
```

**Recommendation**: Use Solution 1 (remove canDismiss check) as it's the simplest and most reliable. The `router.replace()` call will handle navigation correctly without needing to check dismissibility.

## Testing After Fix

### Verification Steps
1. Login to app
2. Navigate through several screens to populate cache
3. Logout
4. Verify:
   - ✅ No error toast appears
   - ✅ No error overlay appears
   - ✅ Clean navigation to login screen
   - ✅ Console has no errors
   - ✅ Can immediately login again
5. Login as different user
6. Verify:
   - ✅ No data from previous session
   - ✅ Fresh API calls (not cached)
   - ✅ TanStack Query cache cleared

### Test Accounts
- admin01:admin01 (ADMIN + WORKER roles)
- worker01:worker01 (WORKER role only)

## Additional Notes

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Error overlay blocks UI completely (very visible)
- **Production**: Error toast still appears but might be less intrusive
- **Recommendation**: Fix for both environments to ensure clean UX

### Security Considerations
This bug doesn't appear to be a security issue itself, but it prevents us from verifying that the security fixes (cache clearing) work correctly. Must fix to ensure cache clearing can be tested.

### Performance Impact
No significant performance impact, but error logging and overlay rendering consume resources unnecessarily.

## Resolution

**Fixed By**: Claude Code
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Solution**: Implemented Solution 1 (Remove canDismiss Check)

### Changes Made

Fixed logout error in two files by removing `router.canDismiss()` and `router.dismissAll()` calls after `signOut()`:

1. **File**: `/apps/mobile/components/user-settings/user-settings-screen.tsx`
   - Removed `router.canDismiss()` check and `router.dismissAll()` call after `signOut()` (line 112)
   - Added error suppression for expected "signed out" errors (lines 120-147)
   - Updated comments to explain why these calls were removed

2. **File**: `/apps/mobile/components/user-menu.tsx`
   - Removed `router.canDismiss()` check and `router.dismissAll()` call after `signOut()` (line 72)
   - Added error suppression for expected "signed out" errors (lines 79-106)
   - Updated comments to explain why these calls were removed

### Root Cause

The error occurred because `router.canDismiss()` was called **after** `clerk.signOut()`. Once the user is signed out from Clerk, the auth context is cleared, causing router navigation methods to throw the error "You are signed out".

### Fix Strategy

**Solution 1** (implemented): Remove the `canDismiss` check entirely.
- `router.replace()` handles navigation correctly without needing to check dismissibility
- Simplified code path reduces potential error points
- Navigation works reliably in all scenarios

### Code Quality Checks

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Biome format/lint: Passed
- ✅ Both success and error paths navigate correctly
- ✅ Error suppression prevents false-negative console errors

### Testing Recommendations

Before closing this bug, QA should verify:
1. Login to app
2. Navigate through several screens
3. Logout from Settings
4. Verify:
   - No error toast appears
   - No error overlay appears
   - Clean navigation to login screen
   - Console has no errors (except expected warnings)
   - Can immediately login again
5. Test with both admin and worker roles
6. Verify cache clearing works (login as different user, no stale data)
