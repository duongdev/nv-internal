# Multi-Task Workflow

When working with multiple todos:

- Complete one task at a time
- Verify each task works as expected before marking it as completed
- Run relevant tests for each task individually
- Only move to the next task after confirming the current task is fully functional
- Document any assumptions or dependencies between tasks

## Task Definition

- Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies.

## Systematic Change Protocol

Before making significant changes:

- **Identify Impact:** Determine affected components, dependencies, and potential side effects.
- **Plan:** Outline the steps. Tackle one logical change or file at a time.
- **Verify Testing:** Confirm how the change will be tested. Add tests if necessary _before_ implementing.
