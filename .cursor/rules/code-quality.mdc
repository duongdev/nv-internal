# Code Style Guidelines

- Use Biome for formatting and linting (not ESLint/Prettier)
- 2-space indentation
- 80-character line width
- Single quotes for JavaScript, double quotes for JSX
- Use sorted Tailwind classes with clsx
- Follow the naming conventions defined in biome.json

## TypeScript Guidelines

Use strict typing (avoid `any`). Document complex logic or public APIs with JSDoc.

## Readability & Maintainability

Write clean, well-organized code.

## Small Files & Components

- Keep files under **300 lines**. Refactor proactively.
- Break down large React components into smaller, single-responsibility components.

## Avoid Duplication (DRY)

Actively look for and reuse existing functionality. Refactor to eliminate duplication.

## Pattern Consistency

Adhere to established project patterns. Don't introduce new ones without discussion/explicit instruction. If replacing an old pattern, ensure the old implementation is fully removed.

## File Naming

Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid "temp", "refactored", "improved", etc., in permanent file names.

## No One-Time Scripts

Do not commit one-time utility scripts into the main codebase.

## Refactoring

### Purposeful Refactoring

Refactor to improve clarity, reduce duplication, simplify complexity, or adhere to architectural goals.

### Holistic Check

When refactoring, look for duplicate code, similar components/files, and opportunities for consolidation across the affected area.

### Edit, Don't Copy

Modify existing files directly. Do not duplicate files and rename them (e.g., `component-v2.tsx`).

### Verify Integrations

After refactoring, ensure all callers, dependencies, and integration points function correctly. Run relevant tests.
