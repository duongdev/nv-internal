# Library Installation Protocol

- Always get explicit confirmation before installing new libraries
- Evaluate alternatives and discuss implications before adding dependencies
- Consider security implications, maintenance burden, and bundle size impact
- Check for existing solutions in the codebase before proposing new libraries
- Document the reason for adding each new dependency

## Dependency Awareness

Be mindful of the security implications of adding or updating dependencies.

## Package Manager

This project uses pnpm with workspaces, not npm or yarn. Always use pnpm commands for package management.
