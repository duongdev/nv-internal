# Database Guidelines

- Use prefixed IDs (cust*, geo*, act\_) for readability
- All database operations should go through the Prisma client
- For local development, use Docker Compose with local PostgreSQL
- For production, Neon database with Prisma adapter is automatically used
- Prisma client is generated to `packages/prisma-client/generated/`

## Development Commands

### Root Level

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies for all packages
pnpm build            # Build all packages
```
