# Mobile App Development Guidelines

- Use Expo Router for file-based routing
- Implement protected routes using Clerk auth state
- Use TanStack Query with aggressive caching (1 week gcTime)
- Make type-safe API calls via the `callHonoApi` utility
- Use NativeWind for styling with Tailwind classes
- Present forms and inputs as modals
- Follow the existing component structure in the components/ directory

## Mobile Patterns

- Type-safe API calls via `callHonoApi` utility
- React Query with aggressive caching (1 week gcTime)
- Protected routes using Clerk auth state
- Modal presentations for forms and inputs
